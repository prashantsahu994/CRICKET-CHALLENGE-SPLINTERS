#Sports Analytics Hackathon

DATA SELECTION

rediff cricket & cricbuzz are the main sources from where data is collected for further analysis and predictions.
The data present over here in a proper manner between australia and india all matches played.

DATA CLEANING

Got nan values in data set,which i modelled via replacing that value with  zero.
the data type of variable is changed whereever necessary from float to INT type.

DATA MODELLING

i have used K-Means algorithm along with herarichal clustering algorithm cause clustering was required to predict the winning team and its data sets.

DATA VISUALIZATION

Barplot is used here to visualize the data because we have to show the cluster response i.e. which clusters is going to perform well or not on the basis of variables behaviour.

EVALUATION

The result was evaluated on the basis of cluster behaviour and their response.
for take a case :->
HOW TO PREDICT TOP SCORER BATSMEN
1.past data is collected from cricbuzz source site.
2.the main column to make conclusion was average and strike rate.
3.the clusters formed are basis on these two variable behaviour.
